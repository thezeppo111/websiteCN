        <h1> HorrorFest </h1>
        </div>
    <p> Slashers are among the most prevalent types of horror movies and they're a particular 
    favorite of modern horror fans. The definition of a slasher film varies depending on 
    who you ask, but in general, it contains several specific traits that feed into the 
    subgenre's formula. </p>
    <br>
    <h2> The Killer </h2>
    <p> Every slasher has a killer. He's usually male, and his identity is often concealed 
        either by a mask or by creative lighting and camerawork. Even if his identity is known, 
        as in the case of Halloween's Michael Myers, he still tends to mask his face. 
        This, combined with the fact that he's usually mute and seemingly unstoppable, 
        heightens his ominous, threatening nature. His back story often includes a childhood 
        trauma (atomic wedgies and the like) that turned him into the homicidal maniac 
        he is today, thus creating a level of sympathy in the viewer. After all, the real star 
        of a slasher is the killer, not the hero. Throughout a franchise like Friday the 13th, 
        heroes come and go, but the killer is constant: the iconic antihero valued for speaking 
        softly and carrying a big machete.</p>

    <h3> The Heroine </h3>
    <p> Although slashers are often criticized for being misogynistic, they're one of the few 
        film genres that primarily feature strong, independent female leads. The heroine is 
        almost always a peer of the victims, but unlike her cohorts, she's virtuous. She 
        doesn't go along with all of the sexual hijinks and drug usage, and if she doesn't 
        outright stop her pals from bullying the geeky outcast who may someday grow into 
        a homicidal killing machine, she at least feels really bad about it. The heroine is 
        also known as the "final girl" because by the end of the movie, all of her friends are 
        dead, and she's left alone to deal with the killer.</p>
    <br>
    <h4> The Violence </h4>
    <p> One thing that separates slashers from thrillers and murder mysteries is the level 
        of violence. Slashers shift the focus of the film from such trivialities as "plot" 
        and "character development" and instead concentrate on the killing. Storylines are 
        basically constructed around giving the killer reason and opportunity to do what 
        he does best: murder and mayhem. The deaths are violent and graphic, and the more 
        originality shown in the methods and tools used, the better.</p>
    <br>
    <h5> The History </h5>
    <p> John Carpenter's Halloween (1978) is often considered to be the first "true" slasher 
        in terms of tying all of these components together—at least the first to gain 
        mainstream exposure—thus setting the standard by which all other films are judged. 
        However, earlier works laid the groundwork, including a pair from 1960: Peeping 
        Tom and Psycho. A lesser-known film, 1963's Violent Midnight, foreshadowed, in 
        the long run, the mystery killers in slasher movies and in the short run, it 
        predated the development of an Italian slasher forerunner later in the '60s.</p>
    <br>
    <p> By the start of the '90s, the slasher concept had worn thin, with fewer and fewer 
        films succeeding at the box office. But in 1996, Wes Craven's Scream, an often 
        tongue-in-cheek affair that toyed with the conventions of slashers, became the 
        biggest hit the genre had ever seen. The slasher was reborn in a modern whodunit 
        mold, generating similar fare like I Know What You Did Last Summer, Urban Legend, 
        and Valentine, as well as, ironically enough, resurrecting the Halloween franchise.</p>
    <br>
    <p> In the early 21st century, the slasher has continued to search the past for its 
        inspiration, as remakes of Black Christmas, When a Stranger Calls, Prom Night, 
        Halloween, The House on Sorority Row, Friday the 13th and A Nightmare on Elm 
        Street have hit the big screen, while the latter two franchises both saw their 
        biggest payday when they combined forces for 2003's Freddy vs. Jason.</p>
    <br>
    <p> As the century has progressed, the now well-established slasher conventions 
        have become popular fodder for parody, from outright spoofs like the Scary 
        Movie franchise to more traditional horror-comedies like Behind the Mask: 
        The Rise of Leslie Vernon, and The Final Girls that have turned slasher 
        cliches into humor. 2014's Stage Fright even turned the sub-genre into a 
        lighthearted musical. The 21st-century downturn in original, straightforward 
        slasher movies is bound to be temporary, however, as cinematic trends—particularly 
        within the horror genre—tend to be cyclical in nature.</p>
