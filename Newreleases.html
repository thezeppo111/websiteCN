    <h1> HorrorFest </h1>
    </div>
    <p> For our featured review, we will be examining Netflix's modern day interpretation 
    on a horror classic. After a few movies in the franchise that have been devoid
    of scares, here are the key questions. Will there be a chainsaw? Will there be 
    a massacre? Find out below.....</p>

    <h2> Leatherface Returns!</h2>

    <br>
    <p>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre franchise never bothered much with continuity. 
        Various sequels, reboots, and prequels ignored timelines, family members, 
        plot points, and tone. The sole constant, of course, is Leatherface. The 
        latest entry ignores everything that came after Tobe Hooper’s 1974 classic, 
        picking up almost five decades later with final girl Sally Hardesty (Olwen 
        Fouéré) holding a lifelong grudge and a new generation encroaching Leatherface’s 
        territory. The ultimate showdown between iconic characters takes a hard backseat
        to a bloodier, rampaging Leatherface and a series of bizarre narrative choices.</p>
<br>
    <p> Melody (Sarah Yarkin) drags her sister Lila (Elsie Fisher) along on a business 
        venture in the middle of Texas with business partner Dante (Jacob Latimore)
        and his girlfriend Ruth (Nell Hudson). The foursome is meeting potential
        investors at the small ghost town they’ve purchased, though their 
        post-millennial, influencer culture persona quickly ruffles the feathers of what
        few locals remain. That includes the sickly older woman (Alice Krige) still 
        inhabiting the rundown orphanage. It unleashes the fury of her adoptive son, 
        Leatherface (Mark Burnham), who embarks on an unstoppable, ruthless rampage.</p>
<br>
    <p> At a brisk 80-minute runtime, director David Blue Garcia runs through all of 
        this without stopping to untangle the strange, clunky generational suburban
        versus rural clash getting in the way of the horror. The intent seems to suggest
        that social commentary and current fads get in the way and ultimately don’t matter 
        in the grand scheme of horror- especially when survival is on the line. However, 
        the impact overrides that with asinine choices, lousy dialogue, and plot threads 
        that never make it past their introductions. None of these superfluous details 
        are necessary; Leatherface is a character that operates on simplicity, and 
        audiences just want to see the slaughter.</p>
